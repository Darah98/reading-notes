#### HTML CSS Textbook
**Chapter 1: Structure**

 HTML include elements to add structure to the page.

    - Tags: they are like containers that tell you about the things inside (they have one opening tag and one closing tag)
    - Attributes (Must include name and value)

**Chapter 8: Extra Markup**


Different versions of HTML have been released. So **DOCTYPE** has to be at the beginning of every HTML file to let the browser know which one we are using. 
* We can add comments throughout our *HTML* page by using:

> < ! - - COMMENT - - >

* comments are not visible to the users
* We can also add IDs and Class attributes along the code to identify elements.

* We can use < div > & < span > to help us group block -level & inline elements.

* < iframes > cut windows in our page to include other pages within the original page. ***i.e include a map from google maps in our website***

**Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout**

- Header & Footer
- Navigation Bar
- Articles 
- Asides

> **HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page**

- The new tags have semantic meanings 
- They help in SEO search results

**Chapter 18: Process and Design**

The process of building a site requires a few steps..
1. knowing the audience and what they expect to see on our website!
2. organizing the information we are willing to share on the website so that the visitors can find what they came looking for.
3. Design a way to present that information.
4. Create attractive interface. 

* *Site Maps* help plan the structure of the website. 
* *Wireframes*  help organize the information included in the site.
* *Grouping* and *Similarity* allow us to present the information in the best way possible.

#### JS and JQuery Textbook
### ABC of Programming
### Important
To learn the JS language, we need to know the *Vocabulary* and the *Syntax* 

***Vocabulary:*** words used in JS

***Syntax:*** How the words are arranged to form full instructions

##### 1/a

**Script** is a series of instructions given to a computer in order to achieve a *goal*.
- Break down the *goal* into a series of tasks that a computer can solve programmatically.
1. Define the goal
1. Design the script
1. Code each step

Computers work differently . They are literal and require basic instructions.


##### 1/b


Computers create *models* of the world by using data. 

* These *models* use *objects* to represent phyical things
* *Objects* 
 - properties tell about the object
 - methods perform tasks depending on the properties
 - events are triggered when user interacts with computer
* Programmers write the code to tell computers to run the code whenever the event happens


##### 1/c


**HTML, CSS & JS** all work together to make a website that works.


< html > is the content layer
{ css } is the presentation layer
( js ) is the behaviour layer

- To link HTML to JS:

> **< Script src = " JS PAGE NAME > < / Script >** 

in the HTML page.

**JS runs wherever found in the HTML page.** *Place Sensitive*
