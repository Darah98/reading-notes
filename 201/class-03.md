> HTML *types* of Lists

1. Ordered Lists
2. Unordered lists
3. Definition lists

*Tags*

- < dl >
    - contains a definition term < dt >
    - and the definiton < dd >

*For nesting lists ( adding a list inside another ) we use  < li >*

> CSS boxing HTML

**Because CSS treats each HTML element as a box, there are many properties we can alter to achieve the wanted style**

*i.e*
- width, height
- min-width, max-width
- min-height, max-height
- overflow: hidden , scroll

**Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance**

1. Border
2. Margin
3. Padding

*Other related properties include:*
- border-width: thin , medium , thick
- border-style: solid , dotted , dashed ,groove, etc.
- border-color
- border-image
- border-radius
- border
- padding
- margin

**In CSS we can hide elements using the display and visibility properties**

### JavaScript Read Summary

> Expression comparisons

- Comparison operators (===, !==, ==, !=, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.

- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.

- **if ... else** statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

- **switch** statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).

- Data types can be coerced from one type to another. All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.

- There are three types of loop: 
1. for 
2. while 
3. do . . . while. 
Each repeats a set of statements.
