**Hello and welcome to my 301-Code Course reading notes!**

First topic to cover is going to be the RWB which stands for Responsive Web Design.

#### Intro
Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

#### Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile
Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same. Mobile, on the other hand, generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users.
