**Hello and welcome to my 301-Read03 notes!**

#### Javascript Templating

The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

- Mustache is a logic-less template syntax.
- It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags.
- mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript.

#### FlexBox
Flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”).
- main axis
- main-start | main-end 
- main size
- cross axis
- cross-start | cross-end
- cross size

#### display
This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.
