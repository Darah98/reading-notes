**Hello and welcome to my 301-Read11 notes!**

### EJS
 is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

### EJS Features
1. Fast compilation and rendering
2.  Simple template tags
3. Both server JS and browser support

### File Structure
- views
----- partials
---------- footer.ejs
---------- head.ejs
---------- header.ejs
----- pages
---------- index.ejs
---------- about.ejs
- package.json
- server.js

### EJS Partials
There will be a lot of code that is reused. They are called partials, three files will be used across all of the site: **head.ejs**, **header.ejs**, and **footer.ejs**.

### Using Partials
The syntax to use an EJS partial is: **<% include FILENAME %>**. The path to the partial is relative to the current file.
