### Introduction to Database Normalization
A process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.

### Reasons for Database Normalization
1. Minimize duplicate data
2. Minimize or avoid data modification issues
3. Simplify queries

### Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies
- Insert Anomaly
- Update Anomaly
- Deletion Anomaly

### Definition of Database Normalization

1. First Normal Form 1NF: The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.

2. Second Normal Form 2NF: The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the tableâ€™s primary key.

3. Third Normal Form 3NF: the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
