### Diversity in Tech-Workforce

* Gender diversity in technical related companies is not that obvious. The [article](https://qz.com/911737/silicon-valleys-gender-gap-is-the-result-of-computer-game-marketing-20-years-ago/) refers to different gender studies that show statistics that suggest to pay attention to the inequality of inclusion of female labourers in comparison to males. 

* Marketing plays an important role in the gender distribution in the tech-field. Advertisements and reviews target a male audience rather than making its language more fluid in order to speak to both men and women.

* The breakdown of employees' gender data in some of the key technology companies show that only one single company has a 50-50 percentage of males to females in their tech-staff. In fact, the only company close to that number is PANDORA with a 49% of female staff. The rest have more men than women and the gap is noticable.

* Although that IS the case in the tech-field, yet Diverse companies perform better: Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.
