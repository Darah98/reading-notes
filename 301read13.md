**Hello and welcome to my 301-Read13 notes!**

### Sending Form Data
A client sends a request to a server, using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

- The action attribute

The action attribute defines *to where* the data gets sent.

> When the form is specified with no attributes, the <form> data is sent to the same page that the form is present on.

- The method attribute

The method attribute defines *how* data is sent.

> The GET method
If a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.

> The POST method
If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.

### Viewing HTTP requests
1. When sending sensitive data, never use the GET method as it displays it in the URL bar, which would be very insecure.
2. When sending a large amount of data, the POST method is preferred because some browsers limit the sizes of URLs. In addition, many servers limit the length of URLs they accept.
