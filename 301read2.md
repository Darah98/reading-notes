**Hello and welcome to my 301-Read02 notes!**

#### What is jQuery?
jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common
JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major
browsers and without any fallback code needed.

**jQuery will help you:**
- Select Elements
- Perform Tasks
- Handle Events

#### Steps on using jQuery:
1. In order to use jQuery, the first thing you need to do is include the jQuery script in your page. You can see that it is included before the closing </body> tag.
2. Once jQuery has been added to the page, a second JavaScript file is included that uses jQuery selectors and methods to update the content of the HTML page.

### WHY JQUERY?
1. SIMPLE SELECTORS
2. COMMON TASKS IN LESS CODE
3. CROSS-BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
