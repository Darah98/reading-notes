#### HTML CSS
**Chapter 1: Structure**

- HTML include elements to add structure to the page.
    - Tags: they are like containers that tell you about the things inside (they have one opening tag and one closing tag)
    - Attributes (Must include name and value)

**Chapter 8: Extra Markup**
Different versions of HTML have been released. So DOCTYPE has to be at the beginning of every HTML file to let the browser know which one we are using. 
* We can add comments throughout our *HTML* page by using < ! - - COMMENT - - >
    - comments are not visible to the users
* We can also add IDs and Class attributes along the code to identify elements.
