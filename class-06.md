 Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code. 

**What is an obejct?**
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

- We can use Literal Notation to create *Objects*
- This is pretty much the most common way to do it^
- Another way to create *objects* is Constructor Notation
- We can acces the properties and methods of an object using square brackets.

>function Hotel (name, rooms, booked) { } 
this.name =name; 
this.rooms =rooms;
this.booked = booked;
..
return this.room

loop is that the statements in
the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met.
