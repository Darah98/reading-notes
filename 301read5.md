**Hello and welcome to my 301-Read05 notes!**

#### Node.js 

**Deploying Blog to Heroku**
 Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications. It's written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on any platform.

 **Making a JavaScript File**
 var http = require("http");

http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
  response.write("It's alive!");
  response.end();
}).listen(3000);

**Running it in the terminal:**
Using the command: node server.js

**When the command is run, Heroku will generate a random name for the application. In my case it's enigmatic-citadel-9298. Don't worry. You can change it later.
