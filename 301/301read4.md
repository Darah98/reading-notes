#### Common Responsive Layouts with CSS Grid

Often when we put images in a responsive grid layout we come across the problem of the images stretching out of proportion. Using
object-fit: cover;
can help, as that will stop the image from stretching.

#### display
Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.

#### grid-column-start
#### grid-column-end
#### grid-row-start
#### grid-row-end
Determines a grid itemâ€™s location within the grid by referring to specific grid lines. grid-column-start/grid-row-start is the line where the item begins, and grid-column-end/grid-row-end is the line where the item ends.

#### grid-template-columns
#### grid-template-rows
Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents the grid line.

#### grid-area
Gives an item a name so that it can be referenced by a template created with the grid-template-areas property. Alternatively, this property can be used as an even shorter shorthand for grid-row-start + grid-column-start + grid-row-end + grid-column-end.

#### grid-gap
A shorthand for grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap
