**Hello and welcome to my 301-Read09 notes!**

### What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

### Pure functions
The first fundamental concept we learn when we want to understand functional programming is pure functions.
1. It returns the same result if given the same arguments
2. It does not cause any observable side effects

### Pure functions benefits
- Immutability
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
- Referential transparency
- Functions as first-class entities
- Higher-order functions
- Filter
