**Hello and welcome to my 301-Read10 notes!**

### Intro
In Asynchronous JavaScript, we have a callback function, an event loop, and a task queue. The callback function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the call back function has been pushed to the stack by the event loop.

### What is callstack?
At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

### What is Temporarily store? 
When a function is invoked (called), the function, its parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame. This stack frame is a memory location in the stack. The memory is cleared when the function returns as it is pop out of the stack.

### JS Errors
- What causes a stack overflow?
The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.
A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.
