## Props and State

### Forms & Inputs

We must manage the state of inputs through our own stateful component and one way data binding.

- Props
In JSX, props are passed into a component with a syntax that looks like HTML attributes. These are the equivalent of function params.
    - Props can be data or functions

- One Way Data flow
One way data flow is a way of describing that state can only be passed down the component tree (not up).
    -  passed from parent component to a child component
