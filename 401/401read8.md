**Hello and welcome to my 401-Read08 notes!**

### Router

- Router is a mini express application. It doesn't bring in views or settings, but provides us with the routing APIs like .use, .get, .param, and route.
    
    - Allows applications to be more modular and flexible than ever before by creating multiple instances of the Router and applying them accordingly

- Route Middleware
    - used to do something before a request goes through.
    - router.use()

### Why use it:

1. Use express.Router() multiple times to define groups of routes

2. Apply the express.Router() to a section of our site using app.use()

3. Use route middleware to process requests

4. Use route middleware to validate parameters using .param()

5. Use app.route() as a shortcut to the Router to define multiple requests on a route
