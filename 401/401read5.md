**Hello and welcome to my 401-Read05 notes!**

### Linked Lists:
 - **Definition:** a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

  - **Types:**
    1. Linked  - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
    2. Singly - refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
    3. Doubly - refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
