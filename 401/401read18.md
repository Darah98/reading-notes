**Hello and welcome to my 401-Read18 notes!**

##  Socket.io

Is a library which enables real-time and full duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers. It uses the WebSocket protocol to provide the interface.

## Web Sockets

A communication Protocol which provides bidirectional communication between the Client and the Server over a TCP connection

- The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server. 

## Connections

The session is “kept alive” through it’s internal use of the WebSocket Protocol, with session information being preserved.

 ### Messaging
- Standard node events are sent with emit() and received with on() … Socket.io uses the same methodology/terminology.
