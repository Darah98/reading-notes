## Message Queues

Message queuing allows applications to communicate by sending messages to each other. The message queue provides temporary message storage when the destination program is busy or not connected.

### What is a message?

- A message is a package of information, categorized by queue and event
    - queue: to which general bucket does this message belong
    - event: what event happened
    - payload: data associated with the event

### Real Time vs Queued Messaging

- “Real Time”: If a subscriber loses connection with the server, any messages broadcast by the server will clearly be missed by the client.

- "Queued Messaging": Any broadcast that is not received by a subscriber will remain “in the queue” until it can be delivered.

#### Use Case

- An API server responds to a POST request
- A logging application is connected to the queue
- A web based ‘dashboard’ application is running and is connected to the queue
- A monitor application is running and is connected to the queue
