    - push ->> to add a node to the stack
    - Pop ->> to remove a node from the stack
    - isEmpty ->> returns true if stack is empty
    - top ->> value at the top of a stack
    - peek ->> to see the value of the top
    - FILO ->> First In Last Out
    - LIFO ->> Last In First Out


- Queue: is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.
    - enqueue ->> items added (rear)
    - dequeue ->> items removed (front)
    - front ->> first node in the queue
    - rear ->> last node in the queue
    - peek ->> to see the (front) value
    - isEmpty ->> returns true if queue is empty
    - FIFO ->> First In First Out
