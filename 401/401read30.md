## Application State with Redux

Redux:

It helps us write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

- Redux Store

The store’s job is to identify the various reducers and middleware that need to be made available and used globally. React uses “reducers” to hold and manage state.

    - Reducers: 
    Reducers typically manage just one part of the larger application state.

- React applications with Redux dispatch “actions” (like an event) with “payload” (data). An action creator function returns an action object with the action type to perform and the data to perform it with. When an action is dispatched, a reducer responds to it, and receives that payload, where it then operates on state using it. Components subscribe to the store and get to use actions with a bit of boilerplate code.
