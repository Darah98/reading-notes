**Hello and welcome to my 401-Read09 notes!**

### Router Parameters

- Express lets us run middleware only when certain parameters are present and expected.

- This will only run on routes that have a city param:
router.param('city', function (req, res, next, id) {
 ...
 })

### Sub Documents in Mongoose

- Using “Sub Documents”, we can use a schema to describe a deeper part of a data model. This can be useful when a document contains potentially a list of other documents

### Joining Data/Documents in Mongo

- virtual joins
    - populate() => connecting two collections
    - Pre and Post hooks (middleware)

- Direct Population (References)

- Virtual Joins
