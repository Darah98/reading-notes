**Hello and welcome to my 401-Read12 notes!**

### OAuth

#### What is it?
an open standard for access delegation

#### How does is work?

1. Application spawns the “Login Using xxx” window, asking for specific permissions

2. User Agrees to allow this to happen

3. Remote service (i.e. Google) contacts the application with a one-time-use Code
    - 'Access Code'

4. The application calls back to a special address on the remote service to exchange that Code for a Token
    - 'Access Token'

5. Once the token has been granted, the application will then be able to contact the remote service, using that Token to access information on behalf of the user
