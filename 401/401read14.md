### Access Controls

Limiting what actions a user can preform on a given resource

### Application Flow and Access Control

Managing Access Control is a process done by the collaboration of both ends; front and back. 

- From the side of back-end developers the can work on the API layer by:

1. Manage the login cycle with the front-end application
2. Maintain the Userâ€™s database
3. Maintain roles for each user
4. Authenticate users (basic and bearer)
5. Create, manage, and apply Role Based Access Controls
6. Maintain and reference their capabilities, based on their role
7. Restrict access to features (like routes) based on capabilities
    - Express Middleware could be used to restrict access to routes
    - Mongoose Middleware/Hooks could be use to restrict access to business logic

- For the front-end developers, they can manage the client layer by:

1. Initiate the login process
2. Store login tokens as cookies
3. Manage login state, capabilities
4. Control physical & visual access (hide/show/alter) to components based on RBAC rules
5. Alter behaviors based on RBAC rules
