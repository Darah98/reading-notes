# Component Composition

## Routing

- `React Router` conditionally renders certain components to display depending on the route being used in the URL 


## React’s props.children

- `this.props.children` is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.


## The Component Lifecycle


- A component can only be in one stage at a time. It starts with mounting and moves onto updating. It stays updating perpetually until it gets removed from the virtual DOM. Then it goes into the unmounting phase and gets removed from the DOM.

- The lifecycle methods allow us to run code at specific points in the component’s life or in response to changes in the component’s life.
