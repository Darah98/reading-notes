**Hello and welcome to my 401-Read26 notes!**

## Custom Hooks

Custom Hooks are JavaScript functions whose names are prefixed with the word (use). A custom Hook is a normal function but we hold them to a different standard. By adding the word use to the beginning, it lets us know that this function follows the rules of Hooks. They are used to extract duplicated logic from components, share common functionality (not state), as well as take advantage of useEffect lifecycle.

- When to use?
1. Handle forms easily
2. Pre-fetch API data
3. Connect to services (i.e. socket.io)

## To conclude

- Hooks are exported as a function, named as useXXX()

- Hooks return data or behaviors (functions) that are required to reuse their internal functionality

- Components can re-use the hook functionality or data/state as needed

- Hooks do not render
