**Hello and welcome to my 401-Read21 notes!**

## React Testing

There are a few ways to test React components.


Make assertions on the exact rendered markup (with content) at any state of the application.

Executes the full component and children. Allows for inspection of rendered Virtual DOM as well as the current state

Similar to snapshots, but allows for jQuery-like inspection of the virtual DOM tree

Executes and renders the called/container component, but does not compose children.

## Deployment

React in development mode uses node service to create live website, this is not what actually gets deployed if you want to deploy your website online.npm run build excuted from the root folder in React application.
