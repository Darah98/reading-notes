**Hello and welcome to my 401-Read24 notes!**

## Hashtables

Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value. We use them to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value

- Terminology:
    - (hash) ->> which is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.
    - (bucket) ->> which is what's contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
    - (collision) ->> which is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

## Hashing

- hash code turns a key into an integer.
- output is determined only by their input.
- the same key should always produce the same hash code.
