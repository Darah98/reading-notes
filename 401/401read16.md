## Event-Driven Programming

Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision.

Every time we interact with a webpage through itâ€™s user interface, an event is happening, making use of:

- An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.

- A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

### EventEmitter

EventEmitter allows developers to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in the project right away.

### Removing Listeners

- To remove event listeners in EventEmitter we can use the removeListener or removeAllListeners method.

- Why remove listeners:
    - performance reasons (the event is no longer needed)
    - avoid memory leaks (if an event listener references an object that is no longer needed)
