**Hello and welcome to my 401-Read06 notes!**

### HTTP and REST

- Server: In the client-server computing model a host designed to provide a service

- Header: key value pair separated using a colon. Headers containing more than one value separate each value using a semicolon. The header section of the request is terminated with an empty line. An optional body follows the header section.

- REST: is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. In layman’s terms, is a means by which we can reference, manipulate, and transfer state.

- HTTP: The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless request-response application layer protocol.

### RESTful methods, their CRUD equivelants & what they do:

| REST method | CRUD method |                     Function                      |
| :---------: | :---------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |
|     GET     |    READ     |            Retrieve 1 or More Records             |
|    POST     |   CREATE    |                Create a new record                |
|     PUT     |   UPDATE    | Update a record through replacement (Put it back) |
|    PATCH    |   UPDATE    |   Update a record (just the parts that changed)   |
|   DESTROY   |   DELETE    |                  Remove a record                  |


### REST Documentation (Swagger)

> The standard for documenting REST APIs is with a “live” documentation system: Open API (formerly “Swagger”)

- Swagger Docs present developers a way not only see how to use an API, but to actually use it. Yes, this is documentation that allows for live requests from with it.
