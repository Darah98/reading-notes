**Hello and welcome to my 301-Read08 notes!**

### What is SQL?

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.

### Relational databases
A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables.

> To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as *queries*.

### What is a query?
A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.

* If we want to retrieve absolutely all the columns of data from a table, we can then use the asterisk (*) shorthand in place of listing all the column names individually.
* In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query.
* When writing WHERE clauses with columns containing text data, SQL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching.
