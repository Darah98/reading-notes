### HTML Links

**Linking to other sites or other pages on the same site**

* < a >
* relative URLs

**Directoris**

*Rules*
* Every page and every image on
a website has a **URL**
* There should be a path to the homepage

*Types*
* same directory
* child folder
* grandchild folder 
* parent folder
* grandparent folder

*You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field*


> CSS Layout

* < div > elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs. 
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks. X You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

> JS Functions

**Functions in *JavaScript***  let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

**Pair Programming** means developers can explain out loud what the code should do, listen to othersâ€™ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

**Good because:**
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
4. Social skills
3. Learning from fellow students
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness


> Steps with FUNCTIONS:

* Declaring a function
* Calling a function
* Declaring a function that need information 
* Calling a funtion that need information
* Getting a single value out of a function
* Getting multiple values out of a function


*Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value*
